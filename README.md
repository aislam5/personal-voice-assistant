# personal-voice-assistant
A terminal-based personal voice assistant built in Python that listens to your voice or accepts typed commands to perform useful daily tasks. The assistant can tell you the current time and date, fetch real-time weather updates, play Quranic recitations, deliver motivational quotes, and even open apps or websites—all through natural language commands.

This project was built to explore audio processing, API integration, and command interpretation—bringing together multiple technologies into one smart, interactive assistant.
